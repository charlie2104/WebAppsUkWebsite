Today i have learnt and used lots of new things. Mainly using PHP and MySQL.

----PHP----
Today i set up the main parts of my login system using PHP. I first learnt how to use MySQLi to select data using queries. I then learnt how to loop
through the results of the queery and store data that i needed in variables. I could then compare the 2 sets of usernames and if they matched compare
the 2 sets of passwords. I ran into problems with this when trying to select things from the database but i fixed it relatively quickly wiht some help.
When the user logs in i set 2 session variables equal to the username and a loggedIn variable to tru. I learnt that these session variables are extemely 
usefull as they allow you to keep track of variables across different pages such as seeing if the user is logged in or not. I also learnt about PHP 
functions and how to create/use them when i created a function that alerts the user of something. The final ting i learnt about when making the login
page was the header command which leads you change page.When creating the sign up age i learnt alot about how to enter data into a table using PHP.
And about verifying a form using FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL and FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL. Once all the verificaton was run i added the details to the database.

----MySQL----
Today i used mySQL to start creating a relational database i learnt how to define a foreign key and also learnt how to edit the title of columns in
a table. I also learnt about using more queries such as lookign for things using operators eg > or < . I learnt about a few new data types such as
DATE and DATETIME. And i also learnt how the two tables are linked.

----HTML----
I learnt how to make a datepicker and a textfield for adding data into the database.

----tommorow----
Tommorow i will start to look at how to populate a table using PHP and hoefully add functionality to add and remove new events.
