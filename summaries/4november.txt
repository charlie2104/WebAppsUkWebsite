today i mainly polished my website by adding a few new things and fixing a few bugs.

----PHP----
i learnt how to hash passwords by using the "hash('sha512',$password)" command. I then stored the 128 bit hashed password in the database and when a
user logged in i hashed the password they inputed and then compared it against the hashed password from the database. I learnt that using a hash
is much more secure than encryption as it is extremely hard to reverse. This is why i had to hash the inputted password as it is a LOT faster than
de-hashing the database password then comparing. Craig also told me that encryption used to be secure but when computers advanced it became less 
secure so when quantum computers advance hashing will most likely fail just as easilly. Today i also learnt how to use a form to delete something
from the table. I couldnt get the delete button to work so instead decided to disply the diary id number and ask users to input that into a form,
which made it much easier.

----MySQL----
i used MySQL to write a querry that deletes data from the table. So i learnt how to use the "DELETE FROM" querry to delete that instance from the table,
i also made sure that i checked the userID of the person logged in and the userID in the table matched so that a user couldnt delete everyone elses
events.

----CSS----
Using css today i learnt about a new display type called flex which allowed me to display the addEvent and deleteEvent forms side by side.
